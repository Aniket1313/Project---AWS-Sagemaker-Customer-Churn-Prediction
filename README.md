## Overview

Losing customers is costly for any business. Identifying unhappy customers early on gives you a chance to offer them incentives to stay. This notebook describes using machine learning (ML) for the automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction. 

We use an example of churn that is familiar to all of us–leaving a mobile phone operator.And if my provider knows that I’m thinking of leaving, it can offer timely incentives–I can always use a phone upgrade or perhaps have a new feature activated–and I might just stick around. Incentives are often much more cost effective than losing and reacquiring a customer.

## Problem Statement

Here we have used XGBoost algorithm to achieve an accuracy of 92.6% to precict customer churn rate on telephone operator data ,on the AWS Sagemaker platform using  S3 bucket.
